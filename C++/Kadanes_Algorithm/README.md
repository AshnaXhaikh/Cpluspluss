## 🚀 Overview
In this file, I documented my journey of understanding how to find the maximum sum subarray from a given array of integers.

## 🔍 What I Learned

### 1. **Subarray Traversal – Brute Force (O(n³))**
I started with the brute-force approach, where I learned how to **traverse all possible subarrays**, using three nested loops. It was helpful for understanding how subarrays work, but very inefficient for large arrays.

> ### 📂 Maximum Subarray Problem – From Brute Force to Kadane's Algorithm

### 2. **Finding Maximum Subarray – Brute Force (O(n²))**
Next, I added a logic to **calculate the sum of each subarray**, This approach was accurate However has a time complexity of **O(n²)**. This helped me realize how repeated work in brute-force can be avoided with some optimization.

### 3. **Kadane’s Algorithm – Efficient (O(n))**
Finally, I learned and implemented **Kadane’s Algorithm**, a smart way to solve the problem in **linear time**. 
Kadane's approach uses a simple loop with a running sum and resets it if it becomes negative, making it super fast and efficient approach to solution. 

This progression helped me deeply understand both problem-solving techniques and the importance of optimizing code.

## 📈 Time Complexities

| Method                   | Time Complexity |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| Brute Force Traversal    | O(n³)           |
| Brute Force Max Subarray | O(n³)           |
| Kadane’s Algorithm       | O(n)            |

## ✅ Outcome

By comparing these methods, I clearly saw the importance of optimization in coding. Kadane’s Algorithm not only saves time but also teaches how **greedy choices** and **smart resets** can make a big difference.
