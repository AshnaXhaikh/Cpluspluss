# Arrays Homeworks

This folder contains C++ programs that practice and demonstrate various array operations, commonly assigned as homework problems. Each file focuses on a specific array-related task, such as finding unique or common elements, swapping values, or calculating sums and products.

## List of Files

- **AllUniqVals.cpp**  
  Prints all unique (non-repeating) values from an array.

- **commonele.cpp**  
  Prints all common (repeating) values from an array, showing each only once.

- **SwapMinMax.cpp**  
  Swaps the first and last elements of an array.

### arrSumProduct (Subfolder)
- **ByReference.cpp**  
  Calculates the sum and product of array elements using pass-by-reference.

- **ByPointers.cpp**  
  Calculates the sum and product of array elements using pointers.

- **AsPair.cpp**  
  Returns the sum and product of array elements as a `pair`.

## How to Run

1. Open any `.cpp` file in this folder.
2. Compile it using a C++ compiler, for example:
   ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./filename
   ```
   *(On Windows, use `filename.exe` instead of `./filename`)*

## Notes

- All programs use standard C++ and are beginner-friendly.
- Code is commented for clarity.
- You can modify the arrays in each file to test with different
