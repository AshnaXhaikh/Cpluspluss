# Arrays 

This folder contains C++ programs demonstrating various array operations and algorithms. Each file focuses on a specific array-related concept or problem.

## List of Files

- **array_input_output.cpp**  
  Demonstrates how to input and output array elements, and shows how to determine the size of an array.

- **find_smallest.cpp**  
  Finds the smallest and largest elements in an array using both manual comparison and built-in functions.

- **findIndex.cpp**  
  Finds the smallest element in an array and prints its value along with its index.

- **findMinMax.cpp**  
  Returns both the smallest and largest elements in an array as a `pair`.

- **linear_search.cpp**  
  Implements linear search to find the index of a target value in an array.

- **passByReference.cpp**  
  Shows how arrays are passed by reference to functions, and demonstrates modifying array elements inside a function.

- **reverseArray.cpp**  
  Reverses the elements of an array in place and prints the reversed array.

## How to Run

1. Open any `.cpp` file in this folder.
2. Compile it using a C++ compiler, for example:
   ```
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./filename
   ```
   *(On Windows, use `filename.exe` instead of `./filename`)*

## Notes

- All programs use standard C++ and are beginner-friendly.
- Code is commented for clarity.
- You can modify the arrays in each file to test with different data.
