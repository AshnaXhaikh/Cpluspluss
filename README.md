# 📚 **DSA in C++ – Practice Series**

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.
The main goal of this series is to strengthen problem-solving skills through step-by-step coding.

---

## ✅ **What’s Included**

* Basic DSA problems implemented in C++
* Multiple approaches for some problems (e.g., loop vs bitwise)
* Beginner-friendly logic breakdowns
* Handling edge cases like negative numbers and zeros

---

## ✅ **Highlights**

* Clear explanations for each approach
* Dry runs for better understanding
* Optimized and clean code
* Covers both **basic** and **slightly advanced** problems

---

## 🛠 **Language**

* **C++**

---

### ✅ **Goal**

To build a **strong foundation in DSA** and enhance coding skills with practical exercises.

---

💡 *More problems will be added regularly as the series continues.*
